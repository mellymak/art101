		<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>

		<h3>Challenge</h3>
		<p> The challenge for this lab is to teach us the functions of arrays and objects as well as how to create them.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p> Referring back to our lecture and with the assistance of my partner Hazel, I had no serious technical issues. Everything was accomplished quite well so far.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p> I created an array that indicates my two main methods of transportation, which includes only walking and the bus.</p>

		<p>I also made an object of the fictional car I wish I owned, which has all the properties listed previously from Lab 5.</p>

		<h3>Script Output</h3>
