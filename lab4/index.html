			<h1>Challenge</h1>
				<p>The challenge of the lab is to think ahead of the high-level tasks and format it in a list form for the computer to process via code.</p>
			<h1>Problems</h1>
				<p>I had a mix up in communication and was unable to find a partner last minute. Therefore, I had the issue of working alone and trying to figure out the process myself. I had difficulties trying to outline the tasks in regard as a webpage process, but I tried my very best as one without much coding experience.</p>
			<h1>Results</h1>
				<p> Completed my lists and added to my index.html file here:


					<h3>TASK 1</h3>
					How to Make a Matcha Latte
						1. Gather ingredients: ½ - 1 tsp matcha powder, hot water, sweetener, and milk of choice.

						2. Gather tools: mug, spoon, and matcha whisk.

						3. Spoon the matcha into a large mug.

						4. Add the hot water and whisk briskly, in an up and down motion, until frothy - about 30 seconds or so.

						5. Add sweetener and milk of your choice to taste and mix until well combined.
