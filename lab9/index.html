      <p>Working with our partner, we are challenged to experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>I personally had issues upon publishing on Github since my stylistic changes to one of the new elements would not show up. The "howdy partner" phrase does show up with their changes on both my local file and on my loaded website. However, my button has not been able to change color at all. Unfortunately, it has remained the same.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>You can check out the results here. How does it look? Good, I hope?</p>
