		<h1>Hello World.</h1>

		<p> My partner Anita and I have a lot in common. We are both in this class, and we are both fourth years, and we are both Porter College affiliates. While I am a film major, Anita is an art major. My favorite food is hot pot, and Anita loves pizza. My favorite hobby is baking and Anita enjoys walking to new places.</p>
