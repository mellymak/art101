				<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
	 		    <p>The purpose of the lab is for me to create a homepage and provide access to all my labs by linking my projects.</p>
	 		  <h3>Challenges</h3>
	 				<p> I faced several challenges navigating how to link the various labs and especially had complications with my image. Luckily, I was able to view the image and edit the sizing with the CSS as well.</p>
	 			<h3>Results</h3>
	 				<p> In conclusion, with assistance from my partner Akilah and additional online resources, I was able to successfully complete the tasks.</p>
