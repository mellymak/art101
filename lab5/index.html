				<h1> Lab 5: Data Types & Variables </h1>

				<h2> Challenge </h2>
				<p> Working with my partner Joey, we are assigned to experiment with basic Javascript data types and variables. </p>

				<h2> Problems </h2>
				<p> Initially on Sublime, I made minor mistakes that would cause the output to be "undefined." I was confused at first, but discovered that I did not have to type "var" in the beginning of the variable. After this realization, the process of creating my Javascript became much more streamlined and worked properly.

				<h2> Results </h2>
				<p> You are witnessing the results right now actually! You may also view the program execution here: </p>
